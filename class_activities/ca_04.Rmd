In this activity, you will practice using `ggplot` to create and customize visualizations. You will use the `penguins` data from last week and today's class. Work in groups to answer the questions below. Solutions are provided for the first two questions, in case you get stuck.

**Instructions:** 

* Spend the remainder of the class period on this activity
* You are welcome to work with a neighbor, but everyone must submit their own file to Canvas
* When you are finished, render the file as an HTML and submit the HTML to Canvas (let me know if you encounter any problems)

## Setup

**Template file:** [ca_04_template.qmd](https://sta112-s26.github.io/class_activities/ca_04_template.qmd)

* Rename the file to `ca_04_your_name.qmd` (so, for example, I would call it `ca_04_ciaran_evans.qmd`)
* In the YAML, change `author` from `Your Name` to your actual name (keep the quotes)

The `penguins` data comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, and `ggplot` is included in the `tidyverse` package. You will need to load these packages (with `library`) to run the code today. If you use the Quarto template, those packages are included in the setup chunk, so you just need to run the setup chunk first.

## Questions

1. Fill in the following code to create the scatterplot below (each `...` needs to be filled in).

```r
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = flipper_length_mm, 
             color = island,
             shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  labs(x = "...",
       y = "...",
       color = "...",
       shape = "...") +
  theme_...()
```

<SCRIPT>
function ShowAndHide(divid) {
    var x = document.getElementById(divid);
    if (x.style.display == 'none') {
        x.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
        x.style.display = 'none';
    }
}
</SCRIPT>

<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('q1_solution')">Solution</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="q1_solution" STYLE="display:none">
```r
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = flipper_length_mm, 
             color = island,
             shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       color = "Island",
       shape = "Island") +
  theme_bw()
```
</DIV>

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = flipper_length_mm, 
             color = island,
             shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       color = "Island",
       shape = "Island") +
  theme_bw()
```

2. Fill in the following code to create the boxplots below (each `...` needs to be filled in):

```r
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., 
             y = ...)) +
  geom_...() +
  labs(x = "...", 
       y = "...", 
       title = "...") +
  theme_classic()
```

<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('q2_solution')">Solution</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="q2_solution" STYLE="display:none">
```r
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = island)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
       y = "Island", 
       title = "Distribution of flipper length by island") +
  theme_classic()
```
</DIV>

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = island)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
       y = "Island", 
       title = "Distribution of flipper length by island") +
  theme_classic()
```

3. Recreate this scatterplot using the `penguins` data. You may find the `ggplot2` cheatsheet [(click here)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-visualization.pdf) helpful. Do you think all the aesthetics used in the plot are useful?

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g,
             color = sex,
             shape = sex,
             size = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Sex", 
       shape = "Sex",
       size = "Bill length (mm)") +
  theme_light()
```
