### Regression

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center',fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
library(latex2exp)
gapminder |>
  filter(year == 2007) |>

       y = "Life expectancy") +

           label = TeX("$f", output='character'),
           parse=TRUE, size = 15) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, 53000))
```

.large[
.center[
$\text{life expectancy} = f(\text{GDP per capita}) + \varepsilon$
]
]

.large[
* But, we don't actually know what $f$ is!
* Regression: estimate $f$
]

---

### Goals of regression

.large[
In general, write

.center[
$y = f(x) + \varepsilon$
]
]

.large[
* $x$ = predictor, aka independent or explanatory variable
* $y$ = response, aka dependent variable
]

---

### Goals of regression

.large[
.center[
$y = f(x) + \varepsilon$
]
]

.large[
How do we estimate $f$? Depends on our goal.

* **Prediction:** given a value of $x$, what is our "best guess" for the value of $y$?
    * don't care about the form of $f$, just want to get good predictions
    ]

.large[
* **Interpretation/association:** What is the relationship between $x$ and $y$?
    * want to get form of $f$ right
    ]

.large[
* **Causal inference:** If I change $x$, how does $y$ change?
    * need study design that allows for causal conclusions (e.g., randomized experiment)
]

**Scenario:** A beer company is conducting a social media marketing campaign, and wants to identify individuals who are likely to buy their beer based on Facebook and Instagram activity. The company doesn't care about understanding the relationship, they just want to accurately target likely customers.

### Prediction, interpretation/association, or causal inference?

.large[
**Scenario:** The beer company wants to target social media influencers who can help sell their beer. Unfortunately, no one in the company knows any influencers. So they decide to identify influencers by finding Instagram posts with pictures of beer. To do so, the company trains a neural network which takes an Instagram image as input, and outputs either "contains beer" or "does not contain beer". They don't care how the neural network works, they just want to identify images of beer.

### Some regression methods

.large[
.center[
$y = f(x) + \varepsilon$
]
]

.large[
* Models often used for prediction (fewer assumptions about $f$):
  * tree-based methods
  * local regression
  * neural networks
  * $+$ others
* Models often used for interpretation/association (more assumptions about $f$):
  * linear regression
  * generalized linear models
  * penalized regression
  * $+$ others
